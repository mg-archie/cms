# CMS

## Description

  This management system was created to give a simple and effective interface to manage employees within a company database.  I want to build an application that could make updating or adding to the database a fast and user friendly experience.  The solution it brings is efficiency and time saved.  I learnt how mysql can seemlessly interact with the cli given the right code.  I also learnt how to use .map() to create dynamically updated query prompts. 

## Usage

  This application is accessed entirely from the command line using keybord actions.  Upon opening users can scroll through the menu using the arrow keys and select a menu option using the enter key.  Users can view and add departments, roles and employees.  Employee roles can also be updated.
